# Bug Report

**Bug ID**: BUG-002  
**Title**: "Remember me": session not persisted across browser restart (automation failure)  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  

**Reporter**: Automation (recorded by test run)  
**Date Reported**: 2025-11-06  
**Environment**: Local, Chrome (ChromeDriver via WebDriverManager), macOS, Java+Selenium TestNG+Cucumber automation

**Description**:  
The automation scenario designed to verify the "Remember me" flow (persist login across browser restart via exporting/importing cookies + localStorage) failed. After exporting session artifacts and restarting the browser, the UI did not reflect a logged-in state and the transient success message was not observed.

**Steps to Reproduce**:  
1. Open the login page.  
2. Enter valid credentials and enable "Remember me".  
3. Click Login and wait for successful login.  
4. Export session (cookies + localStorage) — automation step saves artifacts in memory and test attachments.  
5. Quit the browser and start a fresh browser instance.  
6. Import previously exported cookies + localStorage and refresh the app origin.  
7. Observe whether the UI is logged in.

**Expected Result**:  
After restoring cookies/localStorage the user remains logged in and the dashboard (or other authenticated page) is visible without requiring re-login.

**Actual Result**:  
After restore the transient success message was not observed and the automation `isLoggedIn()` check returned false — the app did not show the authenticated UI.

**Attachments**:  
- Allure results and attachments from the failing run: `JobApplicationPortalTestFramework/target/allure-results/*`  
- Screenshots and page-source captured by hooks are attached to the failing steps in the Allure results.  

**Notes / Analysis / Possible Causes**:  
- The server may set session cookies with attributes that prevent reuse (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite, path, domain), or cookies may be tied to a server-side session invalidated on logout or at browser close.  
- The application may store a token in localStorage under a non-obvious key or it might require additional state (IndexedDB, other storage).  
- Cookies marked HttpOnly cannot be set from client-side JS; they must be set by the server in an HTTP response. When importing cookies via Selenium the cookie attributes matter (e.g., `secure`, `sameSite`) and some flags may be lost.  
- The automation currently restores cookies/localStorage in the test without persisting them to a file (they're in-memory); to triage we should persist and attach them as JSON for inspection.

**Immediate Recommendation / Next Steps (manual follow-up)**:  
1. Manually reproduce the flow in a real browser: enable "Remember me", login, close the browser, reopen and see if session persists.  
2. Inspect browser storage (DevTools → Application → Cookies / Local Storage) for keys set during login.  
3. Persist exported cookies/localStorage to disk during the failing automation run and attach them to this bug for investigation.  
4. Check server-side session & auth settings (cookie flags, token lifetime, logout behavior).  
5. If the app does not persist session across restarts by design, mark this as a product limitation and update the test to assert expected behavior (or change to Option A: run Chrome with a persistent user-data-dir to simulate real persistence).
